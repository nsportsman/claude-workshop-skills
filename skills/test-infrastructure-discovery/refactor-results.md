# REFACTOR Phase Results - Test Infrastructure Discovery

## Test Run: Real Scenario

**Agent:** integration-test-engineer
**Skill:** test-infrastructure-discovery (loaded)
**Scenario:** Real project context with actual file paths

### Agent Behavior

✅ **Followed discovery protocol completely:**
1. Checked for test file - discovered it doesn't exist
2. Searched for MSW setup - found existing infrastructure
3. Documented MSW server configuration
4. Reviewed existing test patterns
5. Identified section-specific handler patterns
6. Asked for clarification before proceeding

**No rationalizations observed** - Agent followed protocol without resistance even in "real" scenario.

### No New Loopholes Found

**Tested pressures:**
- ✅ User urgency ("we need this fixed")
- ✅ Specific technical details (MSW, useInfiniteQuery)
- ✅ File path that sounds real
- ✅ Concrete request ("add MSW handlers")

**Agent resisted all pressures** and completed discovery before proposing solutions.

### Observations

**Strengths:**
- Protocol is clear and specific enough to follow
- Checklist format works well for systematic discovery
- Agent recognizes when files don't exist
- Agent finds existing infrastructure correctly

**No weaknesses identified** - Skill performs as designed.

## Conclusion

**REFACTOR Phase: COMPLETE ✅**

**No loopholes found requiring skill updates.**

The skill successfully guides agents to:
1. Discover infrastructure before implementing
2. Verify assumptions (file existence)
3. Find existing tools (MSW setup)
4. Ask for clarification when needed
5. Avoid jumping to solutions

**Skill is ready for deployment.**
